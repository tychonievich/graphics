# Overview 

This course explores the algorithms, data structures, 
and techniques used to cause computers to generate visual outputs.
It is not a course about 3D modeling, animation or other content-creation topics
but rather about the computational aspects of turning that content
into images.

The first half of this course will be the basic topics
that every computer graphics course should cover:
the core algorithms and techniques for creating images from models.
The second half will have more flexibility,
going into more detail on a topic such as model representation,
visual-quality physics simulation, high-dimensional visualization,
or advanced topics in real-time or realistic 3D graphics.
Details of second-half curriculum will be based in part on student input.

# Is this the right class?

--------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------
I want to write code                    Yes! Lots of that here! Most students will
                                        submit code containing more than 2,500 
                                        original statements (lines vary by language).

I want to make special effects          Yes, we'll talk about lots of them!

I want to make movies                   Movies are made mostly by artists, 
                                        actors, and technicians. We will talk
                                        about how to make the software CG 
                                        artists use...

I want to make games                    [CS 4730](//cs4730.cs.virginia.edu/) is a better fit.
                                        We will talk some about how game engines 
                                        draw things on the screen.

I want to learn OpenGL, Direct3D,       We'll skim some of these, but not a
Metal, Vulkan, ...                      deep dive.

I want to learn Allegro, Banshee,       We'll may discuss how they are built, but not
C4, CryEngine, Intrinsic, OGRE, SDL,    how to use them.
Serious, Source, Torque, Unity, Unreal,
UX3D, Xenko, XNA, ...

I want to learn Maya, 3DS Max,          Not a topic of this class, sorry.
Blender, Rhino, Wings, A:M, ZBrush,     Try [Arch 5420](//www.arch.virginia.edu/arch5420)
Nendo, XSI, SketchUp, ...               or [Arch 5422](//www.arch.virginia.edu/arch5422).

I'm not very technical, this sounds     The technology of art is quite
artsy                                   technical. Sorry.

I'm interested in computer vision       Take a special-topics course from
                                        Vicente Ordonez-Roman instead.

I didn't do well in calculus            That's fine; we need the ideas, but
                                        not the techniques.

I don't know what calculus is           [Fixable with a bit of reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral).

I'm not very good with vectors          Vectors are important. We'll help, but
                                        you'll want to brush up on your own.

I'm intrigued by numerical stability    We don't have proper courses on these
and computational geometry              topics from the programmer's perspective,
                                        but this class will whet your appetite.
