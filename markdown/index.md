# Overview 

This course explores the algorithms, data structures, 
and techniques used to cause computers to generate visual outputs.
It is not a course about 3D modeling, animation or other content-creation topics
but rather about the computational aspects of turning that content
into images.

The first half of this course will be the basic topics
that every computer graphics course should cover:
the core algorithms and techniques for creating images from models.
The second half will have more flexibility,
going into more detail on a topic such as model representation,
visual-quality physics simulation, high-dimensional visualization,
or advanced topics in real-time or realistic 3D graphics.
Details of second-half curriculum will be based in part on student input.

# Is this the right class?

I want to make movies                   Movies are made mostly by artists, 
                                        actors, and technicians. We will talk
                                        about how to make the software CG 
                                        artists use...

I want to make games                    CS 4730 is a better fit.
                                        We will talk about how game engines 
                                        draw things on the screen.

I want to write code                    Yes! Lots of that here!

I want to make special effects          Yes, we'll talk about lots of them!

I'm not very technical, this sounds     The technology of art is quite
artsy                                   technical. Sorry.

Self-driving cars and computer vision   Take a special-topics course from
                                        Vicente Ordonez-Roman instead

I didn't do well in calculus            That's fine; we need the ideas, but
                                        not the techniques

I don't know what calculus is           [Easily fixed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral)

I'm not very good with vectors          Vectors are important. We'll help, but
                                        you'll want to brush up on your own.
