title: 'HW4: Animation'
...

# Overview

This assignment will have you render animations
as a series of images,
using the `pngs` command from [HW0](hw0.html).

If you didn't figure out how to display animations during HW0,
you should definitely do that now.

Most animator-specified computer animations are the combination of two components:
a scene graph and time-varying parameters.

<!--
While it may not seem obvious that this would be true at first,
most animation tools I've used are a fancy user interface over
a scene graph like the one described above
where the coordinates of the positions and orientations are time-varying numerical values.
Often there is a tool called something like a "graph editor" that will display this underlying representation to the animator and let them edit it directly.
-->

## Scene Graph

In this assignment we'll replicate a version of the scene graph used in many animation tools.

Each *object* will have

- a *parent*, which is either another object or "the world"
- an *origin*, which is a 3-vector defaulting to $(0,0,0)$ (not in the required part of the assignment)
- a *scale*, which is a 3-vector defaulting to $(1,1,1)$  (not in the required part of the assignment)
- a *position*, which is a 3-vector defaulting to $(0,0,0)$ 
- an *orientation*, which will be given either in Euler or Quaternion form defaulting to $\langle 1;0,0,0 \rangle$ 
- geometry, given as vertices and triangles similar to HW2

A matrix to position the vertices of an object can be created by multiplying several component matrices together:
$$[\cdots] \quad T_O \; T_P \; R \; S \; T_O^{-1}$$
where $T_O$ is a translation matrix moving (0,0,0) to the object's origin;
$T_P$ is a translation matrix moving (0,0,0) to the object's position;
$S$ is a scaling matrix, the diagonal of the object's scale;
$R$ is a rotation matrix defined by the object's orientation;
and $[\cdots]$ is the matrix for the object's parent, or nothing if the parent is the world.

Matrices are not necessary in this case:
you can also apply the operations directly as
$q \odot ((p - O) \otimes S) \odot q^{*} + P + O$
where $\otimes$ is element-wise multiplication,
$q$ is the normalized orientation quaternion,
$q^{*}$ is the conjugate of $q$,
and $\odot$ is the quaternion multiplication operator.
If there are more than a few points, though, constructing the matrix first is more efficient.

<div class="aside">We have a [quaternions summary](quaternions.html) that may be of help.</div>

The *camera* is a special object with no geometry.
To position an object's points for rendering by the camera,
use $C^{-1}\, O$ where $C$ is the matrix (constructed as described above) for the camera
and $O$ is the matrix (constructed as described above) for the object.
Recall that:

- For any two matrices $A$ and $B$, $(AB)^{-1} = B^{-1} A^{-1}$
- The inverse of a translation by $(x,y,z)$ is a translation by $(-x,-y,-z)$
- The inverse of a scaling by $(x,y,z)$ is a translation by $(1/x, 1/y, 1/z)$
- The inverse of a rotation matrix $R$ is the transpose of that matrix $R^{-1} = R^{T}$
- The inverse of a rotation quaterion $q$ is its conjugate $q^{*}$

You can compute the inverse of a transformation matrix more accurately using the above rules than you can using a generic matrix inversion routine.

Â 

All this organization may seem like more bother than its worth, but scene graphs make complicated and interesting animation much easier to create.

## Time-varying parameters

We'll add animation by allowing various numbers, such as the coordinates of an object's position vector, to be defined by a time-varying variable.

Every file will have access to two variables:
`f`, which is equal to the current frame number,
and `l`, which is the last frame number of the animation.

:::example
If the *frames* argument of the `pngs` command is `30`,
`f` will range from 0 on the first frame to 29 on the last frame
and `l` will be 29 for all frames.
:::

You'll implement several ways of defining additional variables.
To avoid the complexities of a full programming language, we'll guarantee that regardless of which variable definition forms you define

- each variable will be defined only once; no `x = x + 1`-type reassignments;
- each variable will be defined before it is used; and
- variable definitions will be individually simple to parse: no parentheses or the like.

The above limitations will make *writing* the input files a bit tedious, but will keep *parsing* them straightforward.

Some full animation systems will animate vectors separately from their coordinates, for example using slurps (spherical linear interpolation) or hlerps (hyperbolic linear interpolation).
Those can be decomposed into per-coordinate trigonometry and other more involved functions, and to keep the input files from getting out of hand we'll only deal with them in that form.

## Code organization

Start with a copy of (at least the required parts of) your HW2 code.

HW2's `trif` and related commands indexed a single global list of points.
For HW4 the indices will reset each time an `object` command is given;
thus `trif 1 2 -1` is a triangle connecting the first two points *of the most recent object* with the last point provided.

You won't need `loadm` directly; the modelview matrix will be given by the object transformations isntead. We will use `loadp` exactly as HW2 did.

You will almost certainly need two maps:
one mapping variable names to their definitions
and one mapping object names to their corresponding objects.

The file will be organized so that what you store can be quite simple
if you are willing to re-read the file once per frame.
Because variables are defined before use, re-reading will allow you to store just the variable values at that frame rather than full defining expressions.
Because each object's position, orientation, scale, and parent are defined before its geometry
and because parent objects are defined before child objects,
it is possible implement the required functionalty
storing only the transformation matrix for each object,
rendering the geometry immediately instead of storing it.

That said, using more involved data structures and code organization
may make your code easier to reason about
and may be necessary to implement some of the optional components.

# Required Features

The required part is worth 50%

## Drawing objects

pngs *width* *height* *filename* *frames*
:	same syntax and semantics as HW0.

object *name* *parent*
:	<a href="files/.txt"><img class="demo floater zoom" src="files/.png"/></a>
	Begin a new object with the given *name*.
    The *name* may be used to indicate this object as the *parent* of later objects.
    The special name "`world`" may appear in the *parent* field to indicate the object has no parent.
    
    You may assume that the *name* is unique in the file, ASCII, and not "`world`";
    and that *parent* is either "`world`" or the name of an object that appeared previously in this file.
    
    Every `object` line will be followed by its transformations (if any)
    and then its geometry.

position $x$ $y$ $z$
:   An optional transformation of the object; if missing, defaults of `position 0 0 0`.
    
    Describes the position of this object relative to its parent, in a coordinate system modified by its parent's position, orientation, and scale
    but not modified by this object's orientation or scale.
    
    Each object will have at most one `position`.
    If present, it will precede any geometry for that object.

quaternion *w* *x* *y* *z*
:   An optional orientation transformation of the object; if missing and no other orientation command is provided, defaults to `quaternion 1 0 0 0`.
    
    Describes the orientation of this object relative to its parent, in a coordinate system modified by its parent's position, orientation, and scale
    but not modified by this object's position or scale.
    
    Each object will have at most one orientation,
    which may be `quaternion` or one of the alternatives given in the optional features section.
    If present, it will precede any geometry for that object.

xyz $x$ $y$ $z$
:	As in HW2.
    Note that point indexing resets with each new object.

trif $i_1$ $i_2$ $i_3$
:	As in HW2.
    Note that point indexing resets with each new object.

loadp $a_{1,1}$ $a_{1,2}$ $a_{1,3}$ $a_{1,4}$ $a_{2,1}$ $a_{2,2}$ ... $a_{4,4}$
:   As in HW2.

color $r$ $g$ $b$
:	As in HW2.

## Basic animation

add `dest` $a$ $b$
:   Create a new variable called `dest` that is equal to $a + b$

sub `dest` $a$ $b$
:   Create a new variable called `dest` that is equal to $a - b$

mul `dest` $a$ $b$
:   Create a new variable called `dest` that is equal to $a \times b$

div `dest` $a$ $b$
:   Create a new variable called `dest` that is equal to $a \div b$

pow `dest` $a$ $b$
:   Create a new variable called `dest` that is equal to $a^b$

sin `dest` $a$
:   Create a new variable called `dest` that is equal to $\sin(a)$

cos `dest` $a$
:   Create a new variable called `dest` that is equal to $\cos(a)$

Animate transforms
:   <a href="files/.txt"><img class="demo floater zoom" src="files/.png"/></a>
    Allow the arguments of `position` and `quaternion`, as well as the mathematics operators above, to be any mix of variables and numbers.

# Optional Features

## More Transformations (5--35 pt)

origin $o_x$ $o_y$ $o_z$ (5 pt)
:   An optional origin of the object; if missing defaults to `origin 0 0 0`.
    
    Describes the origin around which other transforms occur.

    Each object will have at most one `origin`; if present, it will precede any geometry for that object.

scale $s_x$ $s_y$ $s_z$ (10 pt)
:   An optional transformation of the object; if missing defaults to `scale 1 1 1`.
    
    Describes the axis-aligned components of the scale of this object relative to its parent, in a coordinate system modified by its parent's position, orientation, and scale
    but not modified by this object's position or orientation.
    
    Each object will have at most one `scale`; if present, it will precede any geometry for that object.

anyscale $s_x$ $s_y$ $s_z$ $w$ $x$ $y$ $z$ (10 pt)
:   An optional transformation of the object.
    
    Describes the scale of this object along arbitrary axes as given by a quaternion.
    The application of `anyscale` is equivalent to rotating by the quaternion,
    scaling along the principle axes by the given factors,
    and then rotating back.
    
    Each object will have one `scale` or one `anyscale` or neither; if either is present, it will precede any geometry for that object.

euler `xyz` $r_1$ $r_2$ $r_3$ (10 pt)
:   An alternative representation of the orientation of an object.
    
    Describes orientation as three consecutive principle-axis rotations.
    The order of the rotations will be given by the `xyz` argument, which will contain three letters (`x`, `y`, and `z`) in an arbitrary order (e.g. `yxz` or `zxy` or ...).
    First rotate the object $r_1$ degrees around the axis given by the first letter,
    then $r_2$ degrees around the axis given by the second letter,
    then $r_3$ degrees around the axis given by the third letter,


## More things animated (5--40 pt)

Animate vertices (5 pt)
:   Allow the coordinates of vertices to be variables or values.
    This may mean that the vertices of a triangle are sometimes all the same location in space.

Animate colors (10 pt)
:   Allow the coordinates of colors to be variables or values.
    Variables will be in the linear 0--1 color space and need to be both
    clamp them to the nearest legal value if out of range
    and converted to sRGB before display,
    similar to HW3.
    Values will be in the 0--255 sRGB color space, as they were for HW2.

Animate textures (5 pt)
:   Implement the `texture`, `texcoord`, and `trit` commands from HW2
    and allow `texcood` to be animated using variables.

Animate projection (5 pt)
:   Allow `loadp` to have variables as well as values in its definition.

iflt $x$ $y$ (15 pt)\
else\
fi
:   If $x < y$, perform the commands between `iflt` and the next `else` but not between the `else` and the next `fi`.
    Otherwise, perform the commands between `else` and `fi`, not between `iflt` and `else`.
    These commands may wrap arbitrary content, including geometry, variable definitions, objects, transforms, etc.
    To simplify parsing, one `iflt` will never contain a nested `iflt`.

## Animations used in keyframes (10--60 pt)

piecewise `dest` $v_1$ $t_1$ $v_2$ $t_2$ ... $t_n$ $v_{n+1}$ (10 pt)
:   Create a new variable called `dest` out of a set of old variables using the logic
    
    if $t \le t_1$: use $v_1$\
    else if $t \le t_2$: use $v_2$\
    ...\
    else if $t \le t_n$: use $v_n$\
    else use $v_{n+1}$


lerp `dest` $t_1$ $v_1$ $t_2$ $v_2$ ... $t_n$ $v_n$ (10 pt)
:   Define a variable `dest` to be the a piecewise-linear interpolation of several values.
    Arguments are (frame, value) pairs (with fractional frames permitted)
    and are given in increasing `frame` order.
    Prior to $t_1$, `dest` is $v_1$.
    After $t_n$, `dest` is $v_n$.
    Between $t_i$ and $t_{i+1}$, `dest` changes smoothly from $v_i$ to $v_{i+1}$.

bez `dest` $t_1$ $a_1$ $b_1$ $c_1$ $t_2$ $a_2$ $b_2$ $c_2$ ... $c_n$ $a_{n+1}$ (15 pt)
:   Similar to `lerp`, but using explicit cubic BÃ©zier curves^[Explicit BÃ©zier curves are also called nonparametric BÃ©zier curves or polynomials in the Bernstein basis. They can be thought of as like the BÃ©zier curves in HW2 but with scalar instad of vector control points, or as 2D BÃ©zier curves where the $t$ axis control ponts are evenly spaced.] instead of linear interpolation between $t$ values.
    
    The control points between $t_i$ and $t_{i+1}$ are
    $a_i$, $b_i$, $c_i$, and $a_{i+1}$.
    
    Some variant of this function is used by most keyframe animation systems
    when viewed in the "expert mode" or "graph editor" or the like.
    
    <div class="aside">You might find our [BÃ©zier reference](bezier.html) useful</div>

autobez `dest` $t_1$ $v_1$ $t_2$ $v_2$ ... (10 pt)
:   A shorthand way of defining `bez`,
    some variant of which is commonly used in keyframe animation systems as the initial guess at desired tweening.
    
    The input format matches `lerp`: a set of (frame, value) pairs.
    Control points are determined by computing *slopes* at each keyframe:
    the slope at $t_i$ is $\displaystyle\frac{v_{i+1}-v_{v-1}}{t_{i+1}-t_{i-1}}$
    and the control points on either side of $v_i$
    are computed by extending that slope out â of the way to the next keyframe.
    
    For the first and last keyframe, compute the slope with the keyframe and its one neighbor instead of its two neighbors.
    
    <div class="example">
    The command `autobez x5   3 -2.0   9 7.0   27 1.0`
    computes slopes $\frac{7-(-2)}{9-3} = \frac{3}{2}$, $\frac{1-(-2)}{27-3} = \frac{1}{8}$, and $\frac{1-7}{27-9} = \frac{-1}{3}$
    and thus sets `x5` to
    
    - $-2.0$ for frames 0 through 3
    - The BÃ©zier with control points $-2.0, 1.0, 6.75, 7.0$ between frames 3 and 9
    - The BÃ©zier with control points $7.0, 7.75, 3.0, 1.0$ between frames 9 and 27
    - $1.0$ for frames 27+
    </div>

natspline `dest` $t_1$ $v_1$ $t_2$ $v_2$ ... (15 pt)
:   `autobez` is nice in that it gives us a smooth BÃ©zier that we can then let the artist edit like a bez`,
    but it has discontinuties in its second derivative at each control point
    which, in motion, corresponds to an infinite "jerk force" at those points.
    
    The interpolating cubic spline without these discontinuities
    is called the "natural spline"
    and can be created by solving a tridiagonal linear system of equations.
    Many equivalent explanations of how to do this can be found online be searching for "spline interpolation"
    or "interpolating cubic spline"
    or "natural spline".


## Camera support (0--40 pt)

camera `parent` (20 pt)
:   A file may contain a single `camera` command, which is followed by the camera's parent.
    The input treats the camera like an object (with `position`, `quaternion`, etc), except it may not have geometry.
    See the overview for guidance on how to draw with a moving camera.
    
    For this set of optional points, you only need to support the specific `parent` value "`world`".

Camera in scene graph (20 pt)
:   Let the camera have a `parent` that is an object, not just the "`world`".
    Let other objects use `camera` as their parent.
