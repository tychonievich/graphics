# Fractional Dimension

We often speak of "two dimensional" or 2D and "three-dimensional" or 3D. There are several equivalent ways of defining these ideas; let's consider a specific one: cube counting.

Consider a chunk of some shape that passes though a cube.
Subdivide that cube evenly into $n$ divisions along each axis to make a grid of $n^3$ smaller cubes.
How many of those smaller cubes does the shape pass through?

The exact answer to this question is overly dependent on the specifics of the case^[Some definitions of fractal dimension use spheres instead of cubes, which removes some of these challenges but adds others because [sphere packing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_packing) is a nontrivial topic in its own right.]. For example, an axis-aligned straight line passes through $n$ cubes while a straight line between opposite cube corners may passe through as many as $3n$.
In computing we know how to handle such constants: big-O.
Any straight line passes through $\Theta(n^1)$ cubes.
Any flat plane passes through $\Theta(n^2)$ cubes.
Any solid passes through $\Theta(n^3)$ cubes.
We call the exponent in these expressions the dimensionality of the shape.

This formulation suggests we could have a fractional dimension like $1.2$: we just have to find some shape that passes through $\Theta(n^{1.2})$ of the cubes.
One way to construct such a shape is to find a shape that exhibits that ratio at one scale and recursively apply it to itself so that it exhibits that same ratio for every $n$.

:::example
The Koch curve starts with the following shape

<figure>
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 -1 120 36.641" style="max-width:30em" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-linejoin="round">
<path d="M 0,0 40,0 60,34.64101615137754 80,0 120,0 "/>
</svg>
<figcaption>The starting point of the Koch curve, which you could make by moving forward, turning to the right 60°, moving forward, turning to the left 120°, moving forward, turning to the right 60°, and moving forward again, drawing a line n the ground as you go. The ending point is the same you'd get by moving forward 3 times without turning.</figcaption>
</figure>

This shape is chosen to make the number of cubes not scale linearly;
in particular, shrinking the cubes by a factor of 3 requires 4 times as many to cover it.
That's easier to see at this low resolution if we use circles instead of squares:

<figure>
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="-1 -61 252 122" style="max-width:65em" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-linejoin="round">
<path d="M 0,0 40,0 60,34.64101615137754 80,0 120,0 "/>
<circle cx="60" cy="0" r="60" stroke-width="0.5"/>
<g transform="translate(130,0)">
<path d="M 0,0 40,0 60,34.64101615137754 80,0 120,0 "/>
<circle cx="20" cy="0" r="20" stroke-width="0.5"/>
<circle cx="50" cy="17.3205" r="20" stroke-width="0.5"/>
<circle cx="70" cy="17.3205" r="20" stroke-width="0.5"/>
<circle cx="100" cy="0" r="20" stroke-width="0.5"/>
</g>
</svg>
<figcaption>The same path as the previous image, twice. On the left, a single circle of radius 1.5 covers the entire path. On the right, four circles of radius 0.5 jointly cover the path, one covering each straight path segment.</figcaption>
</figure>

This pattern of reducing the radius by ⅓ and requiring 4× as many circles does not continue past 4 circles,
but we can change the shape so that it does:
we'll replace each of the four straight segments with a ⅓-scale copy of the entire curve.

<figure>
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 -1 120 36.641" style="max-width:30em" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-linejoin="round">
<path d="M 0,0 13.3333,0 20,11.547 26.6667,0 40,0 46.6667,11.547 40,23.094 53.3333,23.094 60,34.641 66.6667,23.094 80,23.094 73.3333,11.547 80,0 93.3333,0 100,11.547 106.6667,0 120,0 "/>
</svg>
<figcaption>An intermediate Koch curve, made by replacing each straight segment of the starting Koch curve with a complete copy of the starting Koch curve at ⅓ scale. The result has the same start and end point but travels 4/3 as far to get there (using 4× as many segments each ⅓× as long).</figcaption>
</figure>

That gives us one more scale where the circles works, but still has straight lines.
However, we can continue the process of replacing line segments with scaled-down copies of the starting shape ad infinitum to get





With $n=1$ this fits in one cube, but with $n=3$ it needs four cubes, not three, suggesting maybe more than $n^1$. But if we zoom in more we find just lines. Let's fix that by replacing each segment with another copy of the same shape

<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 -1 120 37.641" style="max-width:30em">
<path fill="none" stroke="black" d="M 0,35.641 40.0,35.641 60.0,1.0 80.0,35.641 120,35.641"/>
</svg>

Now the pattern holds up to $n=9$; continuing *ad infinitum* we get the full Koch curve.

# Fractals in Graphics

Nothing in nature exhibits a true mathematical fractal: zoom in enough and you find  3D cells or 1D elementary particles.
But many things in nature are visually more fractal than they are Platonic.
Many mountains look more like fractals than they look like spheres,
many trees look more like fractals than they look like cylinders,
dirt accumulates in patterns that look more like fractals than they do gradients,
and so on.
Fractals make a useful starting point for making a stylized model of nature.

Fractals are also useful in that they break up our ability to notice patterns.
The eye is much less likely to notice a low-fidelity image if the image is made up fractals than if it is made up of simple shapes.
Fractals are a useful tool for making a simple model look more detailed than it is.

# Common fractal generation approaches

There are *many* fractals used in graphics, but four are common enough to be worth discussing in more detail.

All of these are forms of fractal noise:
that is, they use pseudorandom parameters to create a fractal that looks random instead of looking mechanical or mathematical.

## fBm Noise

Brownian motion refers to the trajectory followed by a particle that randomly changes direction.
The most common formulation of Fractal Brownian motion (abbreviated fBm) is a 1.x-dimensional fractal created by the position of a 1D Brownian motion on one axis and time on the other.
Many other fBm formulations also exist.

In graphics, "fBm noise" is used to describe any purely stochastic fractal, even if there is no way to characterize it as the motion of a particle.

## Subdivision methods

Subdivision methods provide a computationally simple way of generating a fractal.
Given a low-resolution mesh, replace each primitive with several smaller primitives and then randomly offset the vertices.
Provided the expected magnitude of the random offsets is proportional to the size of the primitive, the result will be fractal.

Naïve fractal subdivision often exhibits visible patterns where the seams between the low-res primitives remain visible in the resulting fractal.
To avoid this the subdivision itself should result in a smooth surface with no visible seams even if there are no random offsets.

## Faulting methods

Faulting methods are not particularly common in graphics,
but they are easy to implement and thus are part of your programming assignments.
As such, we have a [separate page about them](faulting.html).

## Perlin Noise

Ken Perlin made a two-part innovation in the efficient creation of fractals that has become a mainstay of computer graphics.

First, Perlin came up with a readily-computed representation of random smooth bumps.
Pick points on a fixed uniform grid and at each pick a random surface normal,
then fit a surface to those normals.
Conceptually such a surface can be found by making one hill-and-pit pair and placing a rotated copy of it at each point.
Practically it can be found using polynomially-interpolated dot products.

The original Perlin noise used a square grid to create the bumps. The turns out to result in visible axis-aligned patterns, so various alternatives such as simplex noise and opensimplex noise use different grid patterns instead.

Second, Perlin recognized that a fractal can be created from almost any bumpy surface, including his, by adding scaled-down copies of the surface to itself.
This approach, called "octaves", is based on the observation that if $f(x)$ is a bumpy function then $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} f(2^n x) 2^{-n}$ is a fractal,
and that we can stop the sum early once the $2^{-n}$ term is making the subsequent iterations have no visible impact.

Because of the significance of octave-created fractals, octave fractals that are not based on Perlin's random-gradient bumps are sometimes informally called "Perlin".
